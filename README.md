Day 1

- npx create-react-app
    - make sure folder name does not have a caps
    - specify build path
- remove src
    - repopulate, index.js and App.js
    - make sure index.js calls App.js
- Create App class in App.js
    - initialise the state
    - render(return)
- Components folders
    - create Cards, Chart, CountryPicker
    - in each create a corresponding jsx and css (____.module.css)
- API
    - As mentioned above we are using the api
    - create api folder, and index.js
    - using axios make a get request, axios.get()
    - async(), await
    - deconstruct the return data
    - return whats required
- Components/Card
    - deconstruct
    - prior to this is there is a function in app.js that awaits the api data, and when the data comes it updates the props
    - mmm now this is mostly materialise,
    - not that familiar with this so... some other time i guess
